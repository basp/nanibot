# Compile
Compile the required bits:

    lc([markov, markov_server, markov_respond, nani_bot, nani_conn, nani_event, nani_utils]).

# Start
Start the markov server:

    markov_server:start(), markov_server:seed("Some initial text.").

Start the event emitter:

    nani_event:start().

Start the bot:

    Config = [{host, "irc.freenode.net"}, {port, 6667}, {nick, "YourBotNick"}],
    nani_bot:start(Config),
    nani_bot:connect().

# Join
Join a channel:

    nani_bot:join("##somechannel").

# Kill trailing connection process
To kill the trailing connection (currently the connection will stay open event
after stopping the bot) just lookup the pid with `regs()` (look for `nani_conn`)
and execute:

    exit(pid(x,y,z), foo).

In the future Nani will have a proper supervisor so you don't have to worry about
that process anymore.
